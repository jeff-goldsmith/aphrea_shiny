## Packages

In the short course, we'll actively use the `tidyverse` collection of packages for data manipulation; the `flexdashboard` package for creating dashboards; and the `shiny` package for interactivity. Code to install the packages follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "flexdashboard", "shiny"))
```

## Data

We will use data on AirBNB rentals in NYC in this lecture. These data were accessed from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) on September 2, 2017. 

The version of the data that we will use in this lecture can be found [here](./data/nyc_airbnb.zip), and then loaded using `readr::read_csv()`. You can also access these data through the `p8105.datasets` package. Install that package using:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("p8105/p8105.datasets")
```

then load the data with

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(p8105.datasets)

data(nyc_airbnb)
```
